# MWSLOD Readme
Mines Web Service Layer Onboarding Demo

## Usage
This readme should contain references that lead to all information about the various aspects of MWSLOD, but it is generally high level and should not change often.
- [MWSLOD Project Documentation](https://github.com/bcgov/mwslod/wiki) is focused on presenting information from more of a business perspective. 
- [MWSLOD Developer Documentation](/docs/) provides all the details require for a development team member to contribute to the project. This documentation can also run on gitbook if you want to view it nicely formatted.

**Running the documentation on gitbook**

Install gitbook using npm, cd to the folder & run the server

```
$ npm install gitbook-cli -g
$ cd docs/
$ gitbook serve
```
